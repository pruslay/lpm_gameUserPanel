# pruslayPanel
My first project, you can connect your minecraft server to a website with it using MySQL!  Mainly written in PHP (ChatGPT helped a bit :), hashing passwords with BCRYPT. Intuitive admin panel. Simple installer.  You do not need to be skilled to install the panel. I remind you - this is my first project, so I am asking for CONSTRUCTIVE criticism.
